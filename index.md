## Risk (Board Game) AI

I created a simplified version of the popular board game Risk that could be played between humans, AI, or any combination between. The goal was to create an AI sophisticated enough that it could defeat a human player in most circumstances, barring extremely poor luck. The AI is a utility-based agent that features efficient evaluations functions and weights for the different aspects of the game. The number of players are scalable. The AI almost always wins when it goes first.
